Gearman Client for nodejs 
========

Why Another Nodejs Gearman Client?
--------
I evaluated several existing libraries on github, but they either lack features, or stability, or both. None of them have been updated in a year.

Use this one instead!

Benefits:
* full implementation of worker and client functionality
* lots of unit tests
* small
* fast
* low level, lean abstraction over raw gearman protocol


Install
--------
```
npm install https://github.com/mreinstein/node-gearman.git
```

Running Tests
--------
```
npm test
```


TODO
--------
* usage examples
* documentation
