Yet another gearman library for nodejs

I didn't want to create another gearman library, but couldn't find one that matched my needs. I evaluated several:

https://github.com/andris9/node-gearman
https://github.com/andris9/gearnode
https://github.com/cramerdev/gearman-node

The above packages provided some great implementation snippets, some of which I'm using in my version. This library is:
* based on coffeescript
* strives to be a complete gearman library, supporting all available client and worker features
