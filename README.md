Gearman Client for nodejs 
========

I evaluated several existing gearman libraries:

* https://github.com/andris9/node-gearman
* https://github.com/andris9/gearnode
* https://github.com/cramerdev/gearman-node

None of these are implementations of the full protocol, though they do provide some good code snippets. As of the time of this writing, they haven't been updated in 6+ months. 

This library is an implementation of the full worker and client protocol. It's written in Coffeescript, but you can compile this into javascript and use that if you prefer.
